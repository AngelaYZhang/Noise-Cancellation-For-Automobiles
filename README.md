# Noise-Cancellation-For-Automobiles
Senior Design - Fall 2020

Active noise control, also known as noise cancellation, or active noise reduction, is a method for reducing unwanted sound by the addition of a second sound specifically designed to cancel the noise of vehicles' engine.

This project will focus on active noise control (ANC) for automobiles. The objective is to reduce the amount of ambient noise in the cabin of an automobile by 5dB to 10dB. As stated previously, passive noise canceling has been implemented in the past, but it comes at a cost to the environment. Also, passive noise canceling does not cancel low frequency sound as well as ANC can. This is because ANC uses the principle of destructive interference to physically cancel noise. The system consists of microphones, to sense the incoming sound waves, a digital signal processor, to analyze the sound wave, an algorithm to generate an anti-noise wave form, and speakers, to physically deliver a new sound wave to destructively interfere with the primary ambient noise. As a result, the system will reduce the ambient sound, improving the ride of the driver and passengers.
